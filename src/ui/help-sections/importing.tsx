// -- Importing ----------------------------------------------------------------

const ImportSection: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="space-y-5">
    <div>
      <h4 className={HEADING}>Audio files</h4>
      <p className={PROSE}>Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC.</p>
      <ul className={`${PROSE} list-disc pl-4 mt-1.5 space-y-1`}>
        <li>Use the Import tab's drop zone, or drop a file directly onto the Timeline empty state.</li>
        <li>Once loaded, the waveform renders across the top of Timeline.</li>
        <li>The file name auto-fills the project title in metadata.</li>
        <li>To replace audio, just drop a new file on the Import tab.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${PROSE} mt-3`}>
        For YouTube imports, audio comes from a Cobalt backend. Composer ships with a default instance that handles
        verification automatically, but YouTube is currently blocking it. To import from YouTube, add a working
        instance from cobalt.directory in Settings → Advanced, or self-host. Each custom instance shows a small status
        icon next to its name reflecting the last attempt, with the actual error in the tooltip if anything went wrong.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 className={HEADING}>YouTube URLs</h4>
      <p className={PROSE}>
        Paste any YouTube link (full URL, share link, or just the video ID) into the Import tab. Composer downloads the
        audio once and keeps it in memory, so seeking and waveform rendering stay instant after that.
      </p>
      <ul className={`${PROSE} list-disc pl-4 mt-1.5 space-y-1`}>
        <li>The video title fills in as your project title.</li>
        <li>To swap videos, paste a new URL into the same input on the Import tab.</li>
        <li>If a download fails, check that the URL is right and that the video is public.</li>
        <li>
          A small number of videos won't download due to geo-restrictions or rights blocks. In that case, grab the audio
          some other way and drop the file into the Import tab.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 className={HEADING}>Lyrics files</h4>
      <p className={PROSE}>
        Open the lyrics modal from the import button in Edit or the Timeline header (or press{" "}
        <InlineKeyBadge keys={getEffectiveKeysArray("timeline.importLyrics")} /> in Timeline). It has three sections:
      </p>
      <ul className={`${PROSE} list-disc pl-4 mt-1.5 space-y-1`}>
        <li>
          <strong>Search</strong>: queries LRCLib, Binimum, and Better Lyrics in parallel. Type a track or paste a video
          ID; artist, album, and duration narrow the results. Each row shows its sync precision (syllable, word, line,
          or unsynced) and how close its duration is to your project's.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paste</strong>: drop in raw lyrics. Use <span className={INLINE_CODE}>|</span> to split syllables
          (e.g. <span className={INLINE_CODE}>beau|ti|ful</span>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Upload</strong>: drag a file in, or click to browse. Accepts .txt, .lrc, .srt, .ttml.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${PROSE} mt-3`}>
        In Edit, double-clicking the import button skips the modal and opens the file picker directly, like the old
        flow.
      </p>
      <p className={`${PROSE} mt-3`}>
        Supported formats: .txt (plain text), .lrc (line-level timing), .srt (subtitles), .ttml (full timing + agents).
        Imported timing is preserved; plain .txt files get none and you sync them manually.
      </p>
      <p className={`${PROSE} mt-3`}>
        If Composer was opened with{" "}
        <span className={INLINE_CODE}>?title=…&amp;artist=…&amp;duration=…&amp;videoId=…</span> query params (for
        example from the Better Lyrics extension), the values stick around and pre-fill the next time you open the
        modal. Clear them with "Reset fields" in the Search section.
      </p>
